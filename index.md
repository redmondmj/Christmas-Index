# Can you make Christmas something to remember?

**Current Status:** <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">CLOSED for 2025</span>
**Deadline:** December 10, 2025

Remember how excited YOU were on Christmas morning as a child? This year why not spread that joy to a child in need?

You, your family, or your business can help make Christmas dreams come true for a child in need by donating to the **Colchester Christmas Index Program**.

### Ways to Help
Instead of exchanging gifts at the staff Christmas Party or family get-together, why not sponsor a family, make a financial donation, or donate new unwrapped toys, clothing, or gift cards? Gifts for teens are always in high need.

* **Central Equipment Inc.** (32 Lower Truro Rd)
