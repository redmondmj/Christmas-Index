# The Christmas Index Program

A major project of the **Rotary Club of Truro Foundation**, the Christmas Index has been helping Colchester County families at Christmas time for over **50 years**.

Our program exists to help families facing financial challenges and stressful situations during the holidays. We understand there isn’t always extra money for special occasions like Christmas.

The Christmas Index is a cooperative effort of groups and individuals dedicated to ensuring that those needing assistance receive it. Our ultimate goal is to match each family requiring assistance with a supportive group, family, or individual sponsor.

## How Does The Program Work?

The process is a community effort designed to be discrete and supportive:

1.  **Sponsor List:** First, we compile a list of sponsors—organizations, individuals, and families who indicate how they wish to help (sponsoring a family, donating toys/clothes, or financial aid).
2.  **Application Process:** We compile a list of those in need through our application process.
3.  **Matching:** Families in need are matched with a sponsor.
4.  **Notification:** Sponsors are notified of their match as early as possible to allow time for planning.
5.  **Preparation:** Family sponsors prepare Christmas baskets containing food and gifts for their assigned families.
6.  **Delivery:** Sponsors make arrangements directly with their sponsored families to deliver the Christmas Baskets in time for Christmas!
